# Sustainable-and-no-contact-attendance-system

In this proposed project an automated attendance marking and management system is proposed
by making use of face detection and recognition algorithms. Instead of using the conventional methods,
this proposed system aims to develop an automated system that records the studentâ€™s attendance by
using facial recognition technology. The main objective of this work is to make the attendance marking
and management system efficient, time saving, simple and easy.This proposed system will be
implemented with 4 phases such as Image Capturing, Segmentation of group image and Face Detection,
Face comparison and Recognition, Updating of Attendance in database Here python code for dataset
creation,face detection,face recognition and attendance marking is created.Image of the student is
captured by an camera.Then the dataset will be created by these images. Faces will be detected using
haar cascade classifier algorithms.Then the face recognition is done by LBPH algorithm. The processed
image will then be compared against the existing stored record and then attendance is marked in the
database accordingly. Compared to existing system traditional attendance marking system, this system
reduces the workload of people.
